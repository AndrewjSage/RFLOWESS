Title: A robust approach to random forest regression
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Andrew Sage
Maintainer: Andrew Sage <ajsage@iastete.edu>
Description: This package implements the LOWESS-RF method described by Sage, Genschel, and Nettleton. 
    Random forest prediction weights are iteratively adjusted so that outlying cases are downweighted, 
    resulting in a more robust prediction. Outlying cases are identified using a residual analysis. This
    approach is motivated by Cleveland's (1979) locally weighted regression and scatterplot smoothing technique.
